# Graph data structures and algorithms.

This library has been written as the foundation of my [maze generation library](https://github.com/armin-reichert/mazes). It contains an efficient implementation for 2D grid graphs and several pathfinder implementations (BFS, DFS, Hill-Climbing, Best-First Search, A*, Dijkstra). As additional examples, it contains graph based implementations of space filling curves (Hilbert, Peano, Moore).

This library is also used by my [Pac-Man game](https://github.com/armin-reichert/pacman) implementation.
